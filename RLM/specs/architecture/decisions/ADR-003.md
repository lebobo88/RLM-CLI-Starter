# ADR-003: Agent Communication Pattern
## Status: Accepted
## Date: 2026-02-14

## Context
The system uses multiple agents (Orchestrator, Coder, Reviewer). We need a pattern for how they interact and pass control.
Options:
- **Event Bus / Pub-Sub**: Agents emit events, others listen.
- **Direct Function Calls / Sequential**: One agent calls another directly.
- **Blackboard Pattern**: Agents read/write to a shared state (Ledger) but are orchestrated centrally.

## Decision
We will use a **Centralized Orchestrator with Direct Handoffs**, utilizing the **Task Ledger as the Blackboard**.

## Consequences
- **Pros**:
    - Matches the sequential nature of the RLM cycle (Plan -> Act -> Verify).
    - Easier to trace execution flow and debug.
    - Simpler implementation than a full event bus.
- **Cons**:
    - Tightly couples the orchestrator to the specific agents it calls.
    - Harder to add "background" agents that react asynchronously.

## Implementation
The `RLMEngine` (Orchestrator) will act as the central controller. It will instantiate and invoke specialized agents (`CoderAgent`, `ReviewerAgent`) as sub-routines, passing the `TaskLedger` context to them. They return a result, which the engine then processes.
