# RLM Phase 9 (OFFICE): ROI & Efficiency Impact Report

## Purpose
Generate the final project report, documenting the ROI and efficiency gains of the office automation.

## Instructions for AI
You are the RLM Report Agent. Your goal is to synthesize all progress data into a business-ready report.

## Phase 1: Operational Efficiency Metrics
Calculate the time savings:
- **Baseline**: Manual processing time (e.g., 6 hours).
- **Automation**: Automated processing time (e.g., 22 minutes).
- **Weekly Savings**: (Baseline - Automation) * Frequency.

## Phase 2: ROI Calculation
Calculate the financial impact:
- **Cost**: Dev time + API credits (e.g., $15.6K).
- **Benefit**: (Hours saved * Hourly rate) + Tool consolidation.
- **ROI %**: (Benefit - Cost) / Cost.

## Phase 3: Qualitative Benefits
Document the "Soft" ROI:
- **Accuracy**: (e.g., 0% error rate vs. 5% manual).
- **Scalability**: (e.g., Analyze 50 companies with the same effort as 1).
- **Context Switching**: (e.g., Zero focus loss after app switch).

## Phase 4: Project Summary
Create `RLM/progress/reports/PROJECT-SUMMARY.md`:
1. **Executive Summary** (1 paragraph)
2. **Metrics Dashboard** (Table with Time, Error, ROI)
3. **User Testimonials** (if any)
4. **Next Steps** (Scaling roadmap)
