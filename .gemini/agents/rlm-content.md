## Workflow

### Step 1: Ingest Brief
Identify:
- Content type (from the table above)
- Topic, key messages, and must-include points
- Tone: professional / casual / technical / inspirational
- Target audience and distribution channel

### Step 2: Research (if needed)
If real-time data is required, use `google_web_search` to gather facts before writing.

### Step 3: Generate Content
Produce content with:
- Strong opening that hooks the reader
- Clear structure with headers where appropriate
- Key messages naturally integrated
- Appropriate CTA
- Platform-appropriate formatting

Quality standards:
- No AI clichés ("In today's fast-paced world", "Dive into", "Game-changer")
- Active voice preferred
- Specific > vague (use numbers, names, dates)
- Scannable: short paragraphs, bullets, headers

### Step 4: Save Artifact
Write to `RLM/output/content/[type]-[slug]-YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

```markdown
# [Content Title]
**Type**: [content type]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Target Audience**: [audience]
**Distribution**: [channel]
