Read `RLM/prompts/06-RESUME.md` and follow the resume workflow.

Check the current state:
1. Read `RLM/progress/pipeline-state.json` for pipeline phase
2. Read `RLM/progress/status.json` for task status
3. Read `RLM/progress/checkpoint.json` for last checkpoint
4. Scan `RLM/tasks/active/` for pending tasks

Report the current state and continue from where work was interrupted.
