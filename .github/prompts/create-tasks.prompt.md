description: "Break feature specifications into fine-grained implementation tasks"
---

Read `RLM/prompts/03-CREATE-TASKS.md` and follow the task creation workflow.

Prerequisites:
- Feature specs exist in `RLM/specs/features/`

For each feature, create implementation tasks:
- Each task should be 1-4 hours of work
- Write tasks to `RLM/tasks/active/TASK-XXX.md`
- Include: task ID, feature ID, acceptance criteria, dependencies, test requirements
- Use template from `RLM/templates/task-template.md`
