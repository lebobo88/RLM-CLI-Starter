description: "Transform a project idea into a PRD and constitution using the RLM discovery process"
---

Read `RLM/prompts/01-DISCOVER.md` and follow the complete discovery workflow.

Start by reading `RLM/prompts/00-DETECT-PROJECT-TYPE.md` to classify the project type.

Guide me through structured discovery questions (3-4 rounds) to understand business goals, technical requirements, and operations needs. Then generate:

1. `RLM/specs/PRD.md` — Product Requirements Document
2. `RLM/specs/constitution.md` — Project standards and conventions

Use templates from `RLM/templates/PRD-TEMPLATE.md` and `RLM/templates/CONSTITUTION-TEMPLATE.md`.
