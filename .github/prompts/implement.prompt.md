description: "Implement a task using TDD (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)"
---

Read `RLM/prompts/04-IMPLEMENT-TASK.md` and follow the TDD implementation workflow.

Follow the 5-step process:
1. **Load Context**: Read task spec, feature spec, constitution
2. **Write Tests**: TDD Red — write failing tests first
3. **Implement**: TDD Green — minimum code to pass
4. **Verify**: Run tests, check coverage (80%+ target)
5. **Review**: Quality checks, update progress

After completion, move the task from `RLM/tasks/active/` to `RLM/tasks/completed/`.
